# Real-Time Notifications System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
A complete real-time notification system has been implemented for your CodeIgniter application using jQuery and AJAX. The system displays a notification bell icon with a badge count in the navigation bar, allowing users to view and manage their notifications without page refreshes.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Setup
- **Migration File**: `app/Database/Migrations/2025-01-15-000001_CreateNotificationsTable.php`
- **Table Structure**: 
  - `id` (Primary Key, Auto Increment)
  - `user_id` (Foreign Key to users table)
  - `message` (VARCHAR 255)
  - `is_read` (TINYINT, default 0)
  - `created_at` (DATETIME)

### 2. Model
- **File**: `app/Models/NotificationModel.php`
- **Methods**:
  - `getUnreadCount($userId)` - Get count of unread notifications
  - `getNotificationsForUser($userId, $limit)` - Get latest notifications for a user
  - `getUnreadNotifications($userId)` - Get all unread notifications
  - `markAsRead($notificationId)` - Mark a notification as read
  - `createNotification($data)` - Create a new notification

### 3. Controller
- **File**: `app/Controllers/Notifications.php`
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /notifications` - Returns JSON with unread count and list of notifications
  - `POST /notifications/mark_read/:id` - Marks a notification as read

### 4. Routes
Added to `app/Config/Routes.php`:
```php
$routes->get('notifications', 'Notifications::get');
$routes->post('notifications/mark_read/(:num)', 'Notifications::markAsRead/$1');
```

### 5. UI Components
- **Location**: Updated `app/Views/template.php`
- **Features**:
  - Notification bell icon with badge count in navbar
  - Dropdown menu showing notifications
  - Bootstrap-styled alerts for unread/read notifications
  - Mark as read button for unread notifications
  - Auto-refresh every 60 seconds
  - Relative time display (e.g., "2 minutes ago")

### 6. AJAX Implementation
- jQuery integration for fetching notifications
- Dynamic badge count updates
- Real-time notification list updates
- Mark-as-read functionality without page reload

### 7. Enrollment Integration
- **File**: Updated `app/Controllers/Course.php`
- Automatically creates a notification when a user enrolls in a course
- Notification message format: "You have been enrolled in [Course Name]"

## How to Test

1. **Access the Application**: Navigate to your application in the browser
2. **Login**: Login as a user/student
3. **Enroll in a Course**: Enroll in a new course using the enrollment feature
4. **Check Notification Badge**: Look for the bell icon in the navbar - it should show a badge with the count of unread notifications
5. **View Notifications**: Click the bell icon to see the dropdown with notifications
6. **Mark as Read**: Click the checkmark button on an unread notification to mark it as read
7. **Verify Updates**: The badge count should decrease and the notification style should update

## Database Verification

You can verify the notifications table was created by:
1. Opening phpMyAdmin
2. Selecting your database
3. Looking for the `notifications` table
4. The table should have the following structure:
   - id (INT, Primary Key)
   - user_id (INT, Foreign Key)
   - message (VARCHAR 255)
   - is_read (TINYINT, Default: 0)
   - created_at (DATETIME)

## Screenshots Required for Lab Report

1. Database schema screenshot showing the `notifications` table structure
2. Network tab screenshot showing the AJAX call to `/notifications` endpoint with JSON response
3. Screenshot of navbar with notification badge showing count > 0
4. Screenshot of notification dropdown open showing the list of notifications
5. Screenshot after marking a notification as read showing updated badge and list

## Technical Details

### jQuery Implementation
- Uses `$.get()` for fetching notifications
- Uses `$.post()` for marking notifications as read
- Implements `setInterval()` for auto-refresh every 60 seconds
- Utilizes event delegation for dynamic elements

### Security Features
- User authentication check before displaying notifications
- User ownership verification before marking notifications as read
- Proper session handling for user identification

### Styling
- Bootstrap 5 components
- Bootstrap Icons for bell icon
- Custom CSS for notification dropdown
- Responsive design

## Next Steps

1. **Test the functionality** by enrolling in courses and checking notifications
2. **Take screenshots** for your lab report
3. **Commit and push** to GitHub with commit message: "Implemented real-time notifications system with jQuery"
4. **Optional**: Add more notification triggers (e.g., material uploads, announcements)

## Troubleshooting

### No notifications appearing
- Check if you're logged in
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify the migration ran successfully
- Check database for notification records

### Badge not updating
- Clear browser cache
- Check Network tab for AJAX request errors
- Verify jQuery is loaded properly

### Migration errors
- Ensure database connection is configured correctly in `app/Config/Database.php`
- Check that the `users` table exists (required for foreign key)
